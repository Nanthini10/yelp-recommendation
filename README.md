# Recommendation for Yelp reviews(stars) using Surprise package python

## Goal

Uses the Reviews given by Users for Businesses to predict what reviews they will give for the other businesses.

## Data

1. The dataset is from: https://www.kaggle.com/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset
2. Get the dataset and place it in data/ folder

## Algorithm and Results

The package provides various algorithms and evaluation metrics.

Here I've used SVD for the recommendation and MAE, RMSE, FCP for evaluation.

The results are present in the notebook.

## Future work

I'll be exploring the results of other alogirhtms and extend the project.
